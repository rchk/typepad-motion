Welcome to the Following tab &mdash; this is where you can see recent posts
and updates from the people you are following. If you don&rsquo;t see anything
in this window, it means you&rsquo;re not following anyone! Click over to the
Members tab, hover over the picture of a friend you&rsquo;d like to follow and
click &ldquo;Follow&rdquo;, then come back here. If your friends have posted
something new recently, their updates will show up on your Following tab. If
the screen is still empty, it means they have not posted anything yet.
